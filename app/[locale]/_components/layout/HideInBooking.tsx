 * HideInBooking — drops site chrome inside focused, self-contained flows
 * (`/salon/[slug]/booking`, `/walk-in-pay`), mirroring how BottomTabBar bows out.
 *
 * These flows are self-contained (own back affordance + sticky action bar). The
 * global CityTopBar + Header + Breadcrumb + marketing Footer stacking on top is
 * off-pattern (Fresha booking has none of it) and used to crowd / cover the flow
 * — on /walk-in-pay the cookie banner + header literally covered the pay CTA.
 * Server-rendered children are passed through; this only gates visibility by route.
