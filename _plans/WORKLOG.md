# WORKLOG , plain-English record of what got done, per session

The newest entry is at the top. Every session that ships real work adds one entry here, in plain English (what + why), so a future session (or you, weeks later) can tell what happened without reading code or git. Surfaced automatically at the start of every session by `.claude/hooks/worklog.py`.

## 2026-07-07 (later) , orchestrator upgrade: five gates, devil's advocate, model routing, Fable DNA

**What you asked for:** the five-gates work discipline (scope / evidence / adversarial / verify / report), a devil's advocate pass before dispatching subagents, smarter model routing (Opus 4.8 for human-eye and big decisions, Sonnet for code, Haiku 4.5 for reading , researched, not guessed), optimizing dynamic workflows, and extracting Fable's working method before access to it ends. Plus (earlier in the day) enforced rules: don't trust memory, check things exist, own mistakes without apology spirals.

**What I actually did:**
1. **The five gates** are now the canon in the fable-execution skill (section 7.5), written from your dictation: define done + the check before working; evidence before reasoning (cheapest probe first, thin end-to-end pass, two failed fixes = wrong diagnosis); reason adversarially (premortem, kill-your-own-answer, steelman); verify before done (evidence you didn't generate, sample first/last/weirdest, treat good news as suspect); report calibrated (verified vs assumed, cite file:line, never soften a real problem).
2. **Devil's advocate hook** (~/.claude/hooks/devils-advocate.py): on build/dispatch-shaped prompts it forces the premortem , top 3 concrete risks, load-bearing unknowns + cheapest probes, out-of-scope , BEFORE subagents go. Self-tested 4 cases.
3. **Model routing** (~/.claude/MODEL_ROUTING.md): verified lineup (Opus 4.8 $5/$25, Sonnet 5 $3/$15, Haiku 4.5 $1/$5) and a 6-step checklist: orchestrator = Fable then Opus 4.8; human-eye/taste + big decisions = Opus 4.8 (1-3 judges); code written/reviewed/researched = Sonnet 5; reading/mechanical = Haiku 4.5. The old blanket "no opus subagents" gate became a routing gate (opus allowed only for judgment-class dispatches). Self-tested 11 cases. This SUPERSEDES the 2026-06-30 ban, per your 2026-07-07 dictation.
4. **Fable DNA** (~/.claude/FABLE_DNA.md): mined the 3 biggest recent session transcripts with delegated readers + self-distilled , 34 working patterns with real quotes (retract claims on contradiction, instrument-then-remove-the-tap, distrust your own verification tooling, playback-lock, failure autopsies). Pointers added from the fable skills so the next orchestrator inherits it.
5. **Earlier same day:** rules 15-19 (reality over memory incl. unsourced-stat gate, mention is not existence, one-line mistake ownership, contradiction surfacing, post-compaction re-verify) with 4 self-tested hooks; plus a dogfood fix when the stat gate trapped its own description.

**Why it matters:** the orchestrator's method now lives in gates, checklists, and a pattern library that survive model swaps and context packing , not in Fable's memory.

**Not done / next:** nothing open in this batch. The psychology audit's 20 high-severity fixes (earlier entry) remain queued.

## 2026-07-07 , UX-psychology system + enforcement

**What you asked for:** watch a UX-psychology video, research the topic deeply, audit Solen against it, fold it into the design system, and make it stick (a skill + hooks) so it is not just a doc that gets forgotten.

**What I actually did, in order:**
1. **Watched the video** (uxpeak, "The UX Psychology Behind Apps People Can't Stop Using"). Pulled its transcript and 87 still frames. It teaches 6 principles (smart defaults, endowed progress, value-before-signup, IKEA effect, loss aversion, price anchoring).
2. **Fact-checked the video's numbers** with 8 skeptic agents. Found its mechanisms are real but 4 of its headline stats are fake or inflated (e.g. "free samples = +2,000%" has no real source). Recorded the real numbers instead.
3. **Ran 4 research fleets** (80 web-researchers total, 586 findings) on user psychology, conversion, retention, and business impact. Each topic got a ranked summary + a "myth-check" of numbers not to trust. Files: `_design-system/research/PSYCH_*.md`.
4. **Wrote the law file** `_design-system/PSYCHOLOGY.md`: 15 behavioral laws, each tagged by how strong the evidence is, plus hard ethics lines and a table of numbers we must never cite. This is the "textbook" the system reasons from.
5. **Audited all 12 customer screens** against those 15 laws, then had a separate agent re-check every finding at file:line. Result: 113 real findings (20 high-priority), e.g. star ratings shown with no review count on 5 screens, a fake "14 Salons" count on the homepage. Files: `_design-system/research/PSYCH_AUDIT_2026-07-07.md` + `AUDIT_CHANGELIST_2026-07-07.md`. Nothing was changed in the app , these are queued, visual ones stay mockup-first.
6. **Made it stick (3 enforcement layers):**
   - `fable-psychology` skill + a trigger-hook category: when you say "improve conversion/retention", Claude auto-loads the 15 laws so it reasons WITH them.
   - `.claude/hooks/pre-edit-psychology-gate.py`: a dumb mechanical gate that BLOCKS an edit that renders a star with no count, or hardcodes a count like "14 Salons". It does not think, it pattern-matches, so it works even when Claude forgets.
   - loop-reviewer psychology lens: a fresh-context reviewer checks the judgment-call laws (warm confirmation screen, no fake urgency, etc.) on every UI change.
7. **Fixed a real bug** in `delegate-media-read-gate.py` along the way (it was wrongly blocking subagents from reading images, which stalled the video frames).

**Why it matters:** the laws are no longer advice that gets forgotten as context fills. The checkable ones are a gate that physically blocks the mistake; the judgment ones get a fresh reviewer.

**Not done / next:** the 20 high-severity audit fixes are queued, not applied (the [code] ones can ship via the loop, the [mockup] ones need your sign-off first).
