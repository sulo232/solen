# Solen.ch

Swiss beauty + wellness booking marketplace. Next.js App Router + Supabase + Stripe. Deploy: **Netlify** (auto from `main`). Cron via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/cron-jobs.yml`). i18n: de / en / fr / it.

**Current state:** redesigning. Design system in flux — see `_tasks/SOLEN_DESIGN.md` for current values. Don't cite locked tokens (coral / Bebas Neue / Syne / DM Sans / etc.) as authoritative; archived spec at `_tasks/completed/CLAUDE_md_design_system_2026-05-06.md`.

## 🚨 Surgical edits only

1. Never rewrite a whole file — change only the lines that cause the reported bug.
2. Match the exact scope of the request — padding fix = padding class, nothing else.
3. Read before editing — find the exact lines, confirm match, then change.
4. Never `npm run build` unless asked — dev runs on port 3000.
5. `git diff` after each fix — verify only the intended thing changed.

## ⚡ Terminal autonomy

- ✅ npm/npx, git (status/add/commit/push/diff/log), tsc checks, file ops
- ❌ Ask before: `git push --force`, `reset --hard`, DB data deletion, `.env.local` edits

## Workflow rules

- **Functional rules** live in `_rules/*` (code safety, structural, i18n, security, db, lessons learned). Read the relevant one before related work.
- **Incomplete features** → append to `_tasks/INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md` (file:line · blocker · next steps). **Never delete entries.**
- **Error handling** → never `.catch(() => {})`. Always `console.error("[Component] description:", err)`. Auth flows: log + redirect to login. Payment flows: log + user-visible error + retry.
